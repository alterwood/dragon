# DRAGON: Direct Resource Access for GPUs Over NVM

DRAGON is a host-based framework that transparently extends the GPU addressable
global memory space beyond the host memory using NVM-backed data pointers.
DRAGON allows storing the binary memory dump of application data in a file on
NVM and mapping it to the global memory space of the GPU. This enables GPU
kernels to access the data via regular load/store instructions, similar to how
*mmap()* operates in CPUs.

## Getting Started

This project composes of multiple components. To install DRAGON, follow the
instructions in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file. To compile or run provided
example applications, see the [README.md](examples/README.md) file in the
*examples* folder.

### Experimental Features

1. DRAGON-DIRECT
   - Use DMA to transfer data from NVMe to GPU.
   - No host page caching in between.
   - Tracking in branch [dev-nvme-gpudirect](https://github.com/pakmarkthub/dragon/tree/dev-nvme-gpudirect).
   - [Documentation](docs/DRAGON-DIRECT.md).
